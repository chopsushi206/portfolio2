## Development

Added new projects to that section and edited the layout and colorscheme a bit. Also tried to add some effects to the project cards, but removed them due to functionality in mobile browsers. Added a few more animations, along with icons, and a link to my resume. LinkedIn page was updated as well to reflect new skills.
